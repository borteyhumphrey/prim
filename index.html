                <p>Surprises come in many forms, you know
You don’t have me all figured out, as you think
Here’s me showing you more of me
I write
As the weeks turn to months and the months turn to years
I’ll write many pieces for you and for us
It’ll highlight our highs and lows
The joys and sad moments 
I’ll be here through it with you
I’ll send you flowers another time 
Today I wanted to share a part of me I’ve kept hidden 
When you read this, I know you’ll be eager to share your thoughts
But hold it in
Bask in the truth that you have someone who genuinely adores you
Relish it, I’d say
In the coming weeks before I’m with you again
I’ll hold onto memories of your beautiful smile
Sitting with you in church
Sitting on the sandy beaches of your not-so-favorite beach
I’m wearing the Florida t-shirt you got me as I write this
I want you to know I love you 
I’ll most likely start saying that at the end of every call
I promised not to throw around those words loosely, so believe me when I say it 
Some days it’ll be wrapped in jokes and loud laughter 
Some days it’ll be sitting in silence - my usual self,  staring at you being your loud, usual self
Other days, it’ll be wrapped in a frown when you piss me off 
So I can safely say that I do love you
And this only took about 6 minutes to write
Right after you read Romans with me
Paul inspired me, I guess
Not you cheesing at that line 
This is the first of many pieces I’ll send your way</p>
